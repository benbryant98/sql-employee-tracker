## Description

This application works as a framework for employee data tracking. With a responsive user interface that gives you the ability to view departments, roles within those departments, and the employees that fill those roles. You can add departments, roles, and employees as well, with more features coming soon.
No longer will you have to painstakingly write down every detail for every employee. This cleans up the books.
This project has taught me more about SQL and the many applications for it. It has also helped me to understand how I can set up my own SQL database for user data on my website.
